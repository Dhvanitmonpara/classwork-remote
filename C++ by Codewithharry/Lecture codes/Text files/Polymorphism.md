# Definition

“Poly” means several and “morphism” means form. So we can say that polymorphism is something that has several forms or we can say it as one name and multiple forms. There are two types of polymorphism:

- Compile-time polymorphism
    - Function overloading
    - Operator overloading
- Run time polymorphism
    - Virtual functions

<br>

# Type 1: Compile Time Polymorphism

In compile-time polymorphism, it is already known which function will run. Compile-time polymorphism is also called early binding, which means that you are already bound to the function call and you know that this function is going to run. There are two types of compile-time polymorphism:

### a. Function Overloading

This is a feature that lets us create more than one function and the functions have the same names but their parameters need to be different. If function overloading is done in the program and function calls are made the compiler already knows that which functions to execute.

### b. Operator Overloading

This is a feature that lets us define operators working for some specific tasks. For example, we can overload the operator “+” and define its functionality to add two strings. Operator loading is also an example of compile-time polymorphism because the compiler already knows at the compile time which operator has to perform the task.

<br>

# Type 2: Run Time Polymorphism

In the run-time polymorphism, the compiler doesn’t know already what will happen at run time. Run time polymorphism is also called late binding. The run time polymorphism is considered slow because function calls are decided at run time. Run time polymorphism can be achieved from the virtual function.

### a. Virtual Function

A function that is in the parent class but redefined in the child class is called a virtual function. “virtual” keyword is used to declare a virtual function.

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class BaseClass{
    public:
        int var_base=1;
        virtual void display(){
            cout<<"1 Dispalying Base class variable var_base "<<var_base<<endl;
        }
};

class DerivedClass : public BaseClass{
    public:
            int var_derived=2;
            void display(){
                cout<<"2 Dispalying Base class variable var_base "<<var_base<<endl;
                cout<<"2 Dispalying Derived class variable var_derived "<<var_derived<<endl;
            }
};

int main(){
    BaseClass * base_class_pointer;
    BaseClass obj_base;
    DerivedClass obj_derived;

    base_class_pointer = &obj_derived;
    base_class_pointer->display();
    return 0;
}
```

#### Points to remember


- They cannot be static
- They are accessed by object pointers
- Virtual functions can be a friend of another class
- A virtual function in the base class might not be used.
- If a virtual function is defined in a base class, there is no necessity of redefining it in the derived class

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class CWH{
    protected:
        string title;
        float rating;
    public:
        CWH(string s, float r){
            title =  s;
            rating = r;
        }
        virtual void display(){}
};

class CWHVideo: public CWH
{
    float videoLength;
    public:
        CWHVideo(string s, float r, float vl): CWH(s, r){
            videoLength = vl;
        }
        void display(){
            cout<<"This is an amazing video with title "<<title<<endl;
            cout<<"Ratings: "<<rating<<" out of 5 stars"<<endl;
            cout<<"Length of this video is: "<<videoLength<<" minutes"<<endl;
        }
};    

class CWHText: public CWH
{
    int words;
    public:
        CWHText(string s, float r, int wc): CWH(s, r){
            words = wc;
        }
     void display(){
      cout<<"This is an amazing text tutorial with title "<<title<<endl;
      cout<<"Ratings of this text tutorial: "<<rating<<" out of 5 stars"<<endl;
      cout<<"No of words in this text tutorial is: "<<words<<" words"<<endl;
         }
};

int main(){
    string title;
    float rating, vlen;
    int words;

    // for Code With Harry Video
    title = "Django tutorial";
    vlen = 4.56;
    rating = 4.89;
    CWHVideo djVideo(title, rating, vlen);

    // for Code With Harry Text
    title = "Django tutorial Text";
    words = 433;
    rating = 4.19;
    CWHText djText(title, rating, words);

    CWH* tuts[2];
    tuts[0] = &djVideo;
    tuts[1] = &djText;

    tuts[0]->display();
    tuts[1]->display();

    return 0;
}

```

#### Pure virtual functions

You must have to create corresponding functions in derived class else it throws an error.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class CWH{
    protected:
        string title;
        float rating;
    public:
        CWH(string s, float r){
            title =  s;
            rating = r;
        }
        virtual void display() = 0; // pure virtual function or zero function
};

class CWHVideo: public CWH
{
    float videoLength;
    public:
        CWHVideo(string s, float r, float vl): CWH(s, r){
            videoLength = vl;
        }
        void display(){
            cout<<"This is an amazing video with title "<<title<<endl;
            cout<<"Ratings: "<<rating<<" out of 5 stars"<<endl;
            cout<<"Length of this video is: "<<videoLength<<" minutes"<<endl;
        }
};    

class CWHText: public CWH
{
    int words;
    public:
        CWHText(string s, float r, int wc): CWH(s, r){
            words = wc;
        }
     void display(){
      cout<<"This is an amazing text tutorial with title "<<title<<endl;
      cout<<"Ratings of this text tutorial: "<<rating<<" out of 5 stars"<<endl;
      cout<<"No of words in this text tutorial is: "<<words<<" words"<<endl;
         }
};

int main(){
    string title;
    float rating, vlen;
    int words;

    // for Code With Harry Video
    title = "Django tutorial";
    vlen = 4.56;
    rating = 4.89;
    CWHVideo djVideo(title, rating, vlen);

    // for Code With Harry Text
    title = "Django tutorial Text";
    words = 433;
    rating = 4.19;
    CWHText djText(title, rating, words);

    CWH* tuts[2];
    tuts[0] = &djVideo;
    tuts[1] = &djText;

    tuts[0]->display();
    tuts[1]->display();

    return 0;
}
