Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is based on four fundamental principles, often referred to as the four pillars of OOP. These principles help in designing and organizing code in a way that promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability.

# Encapsulation:

Definition: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, known as a class. It helps in hiding the internal implementation details and restricting access to certain components.

Benefits:
- Data hiding and protection.
- Improved code organization and maintainability.
- Facilitates the concept of information hiding.

# Abstraction:

Definition: Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors they share. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it achieves its functionality.

Benefits:
- Reduces code complexity.
- Provides a clear separation between what an object does and how it achieves its functionality.
- Enhances code modularity and reusability.

# Inheritance:

Definition: Inheritance allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reusability and the creation of a hierarchy of classes.

Benefits:
- Code reuse through the ability to extend existing classes.
- Promotes the concept of a "is-a" relationship.
- Facilitates the creation of a well-organized class hierarchy.

# Polymorphism:

Definition: Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type. It includes both compile-time (static) polymorphism achieved through function overloading and runtime (dynamic) polymorphism achieved through function overriding.

Benefits:
- Enables flexibility and extensibility in code.
- Supports method overloading and overriding.
- Enhances code readability and maintainability.
