## **Week 1: "Fix the Foundation or Die Trying"**

### **Day 1–2: OpenCV Basics (Face it, you don’t know it yet)**
- What is a frame?
- `cv2.VideoCapture`, `imshow`, `waitKey`, `destroyAllWindows`
- Read an image, show it, convert it to grayscale, resize it
- Draw a rectangle around a face (use Haar cascades or a dummy coordinate)

### **Day 3–4: NumPy in Image Context**
- Image as arrays: access pixel values, manipulate brightness, flip, rotate
- Try blurring and sharpening manually using kernels and convolution
- Practice slicing image arrays

### **Day 5–6: OpenCV + NumPy Combo Task**
- Build a small tool:
  - Capture webcam
  - Convert to grayscale
  - Blur it
  - Display both original + processed feed

### **Day 7: Recap & Mini Project**
- Face detector using Haar or DeepFace’s RetinaFace
- Save face crops on key press

## **Week 2: “Make Friends with DeepFace”**

### **Day 8–9: DeepFace Demystified**
- Understand what `DeepFace.verify()` returns
- Try manually extracting embeddings using `DeepFace.represent()`
- Compare two embeddings using cosine distance

### **Day 10: ArcFace + RetinaFace**
- Read about why ArcFace is better
- Test with different images: good face, tilted face, bad lighting

### **Day 11–12: Image Quality Checks**
- Write functions to:
  - Check face size in frame
  - Check position (centered or not)
  - Blur detection using Laplacian

### **Day 13–14: Combine Everything**
- Live face quality check + embedding + verification
- Green box for good face, red for bad, message for no face

## **Week 3: "Threading So You Don’t Burn Your Laptop"**

### **Day 15–16: Learn Threading**
- Play with Python threading using dummy tasks
- Understand difference between threading and multiprocessing

### **Day 17–18: Apply to Webcam + DeepFace**
- Offload verification to a thread
- Keep UI smooth while model does the heavy lifting

### **Day 19–20: Optimize and Clean Code**
- Remove redundant calculations
- Use caching if comparing same faces again

### **Day 21: Final Refactor**
- Split into modules: webcam, quality check, model, threading
- Make it production-ready (or at least not look like spaghetti)

If you survive this, **THEN** we talk TensorFlow or PyTorch.  
If you crush it, I’ll even let you touch some *real* model training.  
Fail? I’ll still be here, with more roast than your college canteen.
